                                    Happy New Year! It was marvelous to see many of you at our book fair in Taipei.
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    February marks the Lunar New Year in Taiwan. During this time, almost everyone returns home to gather around the table with family.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    At first glance, New Year dishes may look similar from household to household, but each one carries its own meaning. Fish symbolizes abundance year after year. Dumplings signify prosperity and wealth. Long-leaf mustard greens offer wishes for longevity. A grand stew such as Buddha Jumps Over the Wall represents blessings and good fortune arriving all at once. Through food, a family expresses its hopes for the year ahead.
                                </p>
                                 <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    And yet, if you look more closely, the differences are fascinating. In northern Taiwan, white pomfret is a common choice for the New Year feast; in the south, grouper is preferred. Northern tables likely feature Taiwanese sausage or Jinhua ham, while southern families favor braised pork hock. Different communities maintain their own culinary traditions: Hakka families use preserved mustard greens with braised pork belly or stir-fried pork intestines with shredded ginger. Across Taiwan, regions and households each have their own flavor. 
                                </p>
                                 <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    For Taiwanese people, food has never been merely about sustenance. It is tied to land and memory, and this connection is visible year-round. Hakka mochi, Chiayi turkey rice, Changhua braised pork rice, Tainan sticky rice—many dishes carry the name of their place of origin, because that place is their root. To take a bite is to taste the life of a particular town or community.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    This issue introduces four comics centered on Taiwan’s local food culture. Through these stories, we hope readers will not only discover the warmth and humanity behind each dish, but also gain a deeper understanding of Taiwan and the sources of inspiration that nourish these creators.
                                </p>

                                    But before we tell you about the four books we’ve selected, we invite you to follow our Instagram (<a href="https://instagram.com/taiwanbookshelf" target="_blank">＠taiwanbookshelf</a>). If you are attending the book fairs in Bangkok or Bologna, we would love to meet you. Please feel free to reply to this email.

                                    Two comics are set during Taiwan’s era of Japanese colonial rule. <em>Tomoe’s Memories of Koumeya</em> follows a young Japanese girl growing up in Taiwan who, while preparing for a school festival, discovers the richness of Taiwanese cuisine. The culminating fair reflects a true exchange of cultures. Meanwhile, <em>The Nature Chef</em> centers on Panay, an Indigenous girl who leaves her village to work as a cook for a Japanese family to support her ailing sister. Drawing on her own culinary knowledge, she reimagines Japanese home cooking and forms a quiet bond with the family’s eldest son. Through her food, he gains a deeper appreciation of Indigenous traditions and ecological wisdom.
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    In <em>The Signature Dish</em>, set in the present day, a chef trained in France returns to Taiwan, eager to recreate his mother’s signature dish: minced meat with pickled cucumber. He learns from a local master at a roadside stall, and through this work, rediscovers the flavors and memories of home.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    <em>Formosa Oolong Tea</em> is a sweeping series tracing how Taiwanese oolong tea gained international renown. Despite tea farmers’ distrust, official resistance, and fierce competition, the Scottish merchant Dodd and Li Chunsheng, a Xiamen-born comprador, introduced Taiwanese oolong tea directly to the global market. Their vision laid the foundation for the industry and carried its flavor far beyond the island’s shores.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    From a school festival’s cultural exchange to a chef’s search for his roots, from wild mountain greens to the global tea trade, these four works explore the same questions: How does food shape personal memory? How can it impact the history of an island? Through comics, we see not merely cuisine, but cultural encounters, emotional currents, and the transformations of an era.

                                    Set in Taishō-era Taipei—a period of flourishing urban entertainment, vibrant social life, and a richly diverse food culture—this story follows Tomoe, a high school student and heir to a renowned traditional restaurant (ryōtei). Tasked with organizing the food for her school’s upcoming festival, Tomoe is determined to prove herself to her grandmother, the restaurant’s formidable first-generation proprietress.

The international flavors they create become the highlight of the festival, delighting everyone in attendance.

It is a story that transports readers to a city alive with cultural exchange, where food becomes both memory and celebration.

                                    After a disappointing loss in a French culinary competition, young chef Ching-Hsiung returns to Taiwan in search of the true essence of cooking. Determined to recreate his mother’s signature dish—minced meat with pickled cucumber—he struggles to capture its familiar taste. Then he meets Master Awang, a legendary chef who roams the island in a food truck, serving dishes tailored to each customer. Ching-Hsiung learns that what’s missing is not a recipe, but the love and care his mother once poured into every meal.

This book celebrates the power of food to nourish not only the body, but also the heart.

                                    During World War II, a brilliant young girl named Panay, gifted in cooking, works as a housemaid for the Ikegami family. Panay is Amis, one of Taiwan’s Indigenous peoples, while the Ikegamis are Japanese and have relocated to Hualien Harbor. In an age of scarcity, Panay blends local ingredients with tribal culinary traditions, creating distinctive Japanese-style dishes. Her food awakens the palate and comforts the homesick hearts of the Ikegami family. Meanwhile, her friendship with Shinsuke, a Japanese policeman and the family’s eldest son, slowly blossoms.

                                    How did Taiwan’s oolong tea come to be so famous? Before the Opium Wars, the major ports of Qing China bustled with sailing ships. Loaded with goods, these ships would sail away, traveling to Britain and Europe. The most significant of these goods was tea—second only to water as the world’s most consumed beverage in the world.

                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    After Taiwan’s port Tamsui was established, the island became a new home for immigrants and adventurers. John Dodd, a Scottish merchant, partnered with Li Chunsheng, a savvy comprador. Together, they set their sights on the vast American market, betting future fortunes on a dream product—Taiwanese oolong tea. They overcame the distrust and difficulties posed by tea farmers, government officials, inspections, and Hong Kong firms to bring their vision to life.

                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    For the next thirty years, tea accounted for more than half of Taiwan’s total export value, establishing Taipei as the island's political and economic center—a status it holds to this day. This book tells the story of two people who recognized the untapped potential of a local resource. Their pioneering efforts earned them the title of "Fathers of Taiwanese Tea."
